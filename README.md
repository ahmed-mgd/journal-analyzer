# Journal Analyzer (IN PROGRESS...)

An application that allows users to scan journal entries, builds a comprehensive history with the data, and analyzes the user's well-being over time. The intention is to allow the user to reflect on their lifestyle choices and how it affects their mental health.

This project is intended primarily for personal use as I prefer to journal on paper, and scanning would be a hassle for a sane individual (which I am not). More details to come...
